1. The implementation of the ith order statistic was accomplished by leveraging the quicksort algorithm. First, I modified the quicksort algorithm to partition the array based on a pivot element, then recursively sort the subarrays. Once the array is sorted, I could easily locate the ith order statistic by accessing the ith element of the sorted array. To demonstrate its functionality, I applied this implementation to an example array. For instance, given an array [5, 3, 8, 2, 1, 7] and i = 3, the third order statistic would be 5, as it represents the third smallest element in the sorted array.

2. The implementation of the stack, queue, and singly linked list was completed using fixed-sized arrays and restricted to storing integers only. Each data structure adheres to the specified API/interface outlined in the provided reference material. For the stack, I ensured functionalities such as push, pop, and peek were implemented correctly. Similarly, for the queue, enqueue, dequeue, and peek functionalities were implemented. Lastly, for the singly linked list, I implemented functionalities for insertion, deletion, and traversal. All implementations have been uploaded to GitHub for reference and review.
